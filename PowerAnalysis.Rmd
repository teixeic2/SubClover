Power analysis 

```{rloadlibraries}
library(tidyr)
library (dplyr)
library (ggplot2)
library(agricolae)
setwd("C:\\Users\\Ed\\Documents\\Subclovergit")
getwd()
dev.off()
#Analysis of Experiment 3 - Field Iversen 2 - 6 cultivars 
#create file 
file <- read.table("ColdPercPlant.txt",header=TRUE)
file
head(file)
summary (file)

```

The following four quantities have an intimate relationship:
sample size
effect size
significance level = P(Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there
power = 1 - P(Type II error) = probability of finding an effect that is there
Given any three, we can determine the fourth.
```{r, powerscript}
power.t.test(n=15, 
             delta=1.6,
             sd=1.4,
             )
```
